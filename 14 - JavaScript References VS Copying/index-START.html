    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Dink', 'Rchan', 'PDL', 'Monchan'];
    const team = players;
    console.log(team, players);
    team[3] = 'lux';

    // team is a reference to the original array,
    // this is a different behavior than the strings/ numbers
    // so, when you update an array it will always reference back to the original.

    // to get around this phenomenon we will COPY the array


    // and we want to make a copy of it. By using slice() without any arguments

    const team2 = players.slice();

    // OR we can concat an empty array

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // OR we can use the es6 way and spread into the array
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {
        name: 'Might Mike',
        age: 998
    }

    // and think we make a copy: 
    const captian = person;
    // but this is only a reference
    captian.number = 69;
    // how do we take a copy instead? by using Object.assign, 
    // leaving the array empty (1st argument), include the object you want to change (2nd argument)
    // then assigning the updates in another array (3rd argument)
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 163, name: 'Thomas the Train'});
    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread not in js yet
    //const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const monchan = {
        name: 'Monster',
        age: 42,
        social: {
            twitter: '@monchan',
            facebook: 'bird.destroier'
        }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(monchan);
    // updating the social on this will change the original monchan
    const dev = Object.assign({}, monchan)

    // the poor man's way of cloning an object
    // object -> string -> object
    const monchan2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(monchan));
